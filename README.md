# Snake-game-using-C
This code creates a simple console-based snake game in C. The snake moves with the WASD keys, grows when it eats the fruit, and ends the game when it hits the boundaries or itself. The score increments with each fruit eaten. This is a basic implementation; you can enhance it further by adding features like speed increments, obstacles, or additional game modes.
